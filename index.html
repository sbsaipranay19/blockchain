                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>A blockchain is a shared ledger that stores information about transactions in a distributed manner. These transactions are performed between people within a blockchain, which is formed by its participantsâ€™ computers. These computers provide the computing power to constantly maintain the blockchain (by performing computations and verifying transactions).
                  Such computers are called nodes, and each node in the network owns a full copy of the blockchain.</p>
                  <p>Technically, a blockchain is a chain of blocks ordered in a network of non-trusted peers. Each block references the previous one and contains data, its own hash, and the hash of the previous block.
                  A block stores encrypted details about the parties whose interaction resulted in the data stored in the block. A cryptocurrency block also contains the senderâ€™s and receiverâ€™s encrypted identifiers. A block for an ecommerce transaction will contain the identifiers of the retailer and consumer, for example.</p>
                  <h4>Each block also has a hash. This hash is a value generated from a string of text using a mathematical function. A hash can be compared to a fingerprint, as each hash is unique. Its role is to identify a block and the blockâ€™s contents.</h4>

                <p> Sending currency across a blockchain involves a number of steps. </p>
                <p> ->A request - You tell the network you want to send some of your currency to someone else. You do this via the software the network uses. The simplest and easiest way is to use a Wallet. <br> <br>
                    ->Check the records - The nodes on the network peer through the records on blockchain to make sure you have the currency to spend, and you havenâ€™t already spent it. <br> <br>
                    ->Filing - Once the network confirms the transaction can go ahead, it adds it to the existing block of transactions to be verified by nodes. <br> <br>
                    ->Security - Once that happens it canâ€™t undone or tampered with, as every other transaction in that block will have to be resubmitted, which would give everyone a bit of a headache.</p>

                <p>This vulnerability is particularly attributed in Bitcoin Technology, where adversaries look
                    forward to using the same digital cryptocurrency for more than
                    one transactions. Since reproducing of digital information is
                    easy to achieve, the occurrence of double spending is possible
                    in reality. To conduct such event, the attackers must have a
                    strong hash power and must be able to generate a longer
                    private chain compared to public blockchain. The attack is
                    carried out in the following steps: <br> <br>
                    1) Starting from block N, privately mine to extend the
                    blockchain as much as possible but do not publicize. <br> <br>
                    2) Broadcast the transaction to the organization of interest. <br> <br>
                    3) Wait patiently until enough confirmations are received
                    and the transaction successfully gets recorded in the
                    blockchain, so that the merchant dispatches the product. <br> <br>
                    4) Secretly mine for extending the private branch until
                    it is longer than public branch. If succeeds in doing
                    so, publicize the secret branch that will be eventually</p>

            <p>These two algorithms have the same purpose: verifying the transaction. The only difference is the process. PoW rewards miners who solve a mathematical puzzle first, while PoS relies upon the minerâ€™s wealth (stake). In the second system, there are no rewards, as miners charge fees for verifying transactions.</p>       
            <p>Once both the transactions wait in the cloud comes first is verified and than it stopped from accepting a transaction with similar values.</p>
